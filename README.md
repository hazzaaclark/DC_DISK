# DC_DISK
Versatile Dreamcast ROM-creation toolkit 

# Motive:

The motive behind this project is to provide an ease-of-use means of being able to make
your own SEGA Dreamcast ROMS homemade, from code you have wrote of your own with your own development tools

What this means is being able to have a surrogate means of debugging your own software on Dreamcast emulators and the such.

I made this project with the sole intention of this being able to provide a technical aid in my University dissertation.

All in accordance with the Creative Commons license, I am looking to make toolkits and emulation software all within the best interest of 
furthering my Computer Architecture skillset (which is what I am looking to make my Dissertation all about)
